Working on a project which a user will give a query for a case that involves certain ideas, and it will return a case that set precedent for that.
Only working w/ federal court cases


Currently working on collecting a dataset of these decisions through the govinfo API. 
Almost done on the correct API links, realized I have to switch the database im selecting from. I did collections, but the more suitable setting is published
currently can access PDF of cases given by the API. Working on maneuvering through API,then need to download to csv.


After making dataset will do the ML and data analysis
